# DirectFund

### A decentralized app for raising funds via donations and blind auctions.
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify">We often come across fund raisers on Facebook and other social media
platforms where people donate money to raise funds for a particular person
or an organization or for a certain cause. There are many entities involved in
this donation process other than just the donor and the recipient of the
donation. Because of this we almost always worry if our donations are
reaching the recipient intact without intervention from any middlemen.</li>
<li>This issue can be easily addressed by making the donation process
decentralized. DirectFund-Dapp will allow anyone across the world to make
donations directly to the person or the fund without worrying about anyone
interfering.</li>
<li>Another feature that I wish to incorporate in my Dapp is, a feature to allow a
person to sell anything to whoever bids highest for it in order to raise funds.
Even in this case, the funds will go directly from the buyer to the recipient of
the donation/charity and not to the seller instead.</li>
</ul>
